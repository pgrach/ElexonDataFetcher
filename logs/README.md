# Bitcoin Mining Analytics Platform - Log Files

This directory contains log files generated by the Bitcoin Mining Analytics platform's various subsystems.

## Log Types

The system generates several types of log files, each with a date suffix (YYYY-MM-DD):

- `app_*.log` - General application logs, including startup, shutdown, and system events
- `performance_*.log` - Performance metrics and timing information for API calls and calculations
- `request_*.log` - Detailed logs of incoming HTTP requests
- `response_*.log` - Detailed logs of outgoing HTTP responses
- `daily_reconciliation_*.log` - Logs from the daily reconciliation process
- `reconciliation_*.log` - Logs from the unified reconciliation system
- `critical_date_*.log` - Logs from processing problematic dates in the reconciliation system
- `process_critical_date_*.log` - Detailed logs for critical date processing

## Log Rotation

- Log files are automatically rotated daily
- Each log file is named with the date it was created
- Older log files can be safely archived or deleted as needed

## Log Analysis

- These logs are valuable for troubleshooting and performance analysis
- The `performance_*.log` files are particularly useful for identifying bottlenecks
- The `daily_reconciliation_*.log` files help track the accuracy of data processing
