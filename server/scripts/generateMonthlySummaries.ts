// This file has been removed as its functionality is now covered by ingestMonthlyData.ts
// If you need to generate monthly summaries:
// 1. For new data: use ingestMonthlyData.ts which will automatically generate summaries
//    Example: npm run ingest-month 2024-08
// 2. For existing data: ingestMonthlyData.ts will recalculate summaries automatically
//    when processing any day in the month
