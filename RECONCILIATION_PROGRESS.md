## Recent Activity

- Started processing the most critical date (2022-10-06) using minimal_reconciliation.ts
- Implemented process_critical_date.sh for focused reconciliation of problematic dates
- Created analyze_reconciliation.sh to monitor and report on progress
- Developed process_critical_batch.sh for sequential processing of multiple critical dates
- Documented comprehensive reconciliation strategy in RECONCILIATION_GUIDE.md

## Implementation Strategy

Our approach to completing the reconciliation is prioritized as follows:

1. **Critical Dates First**: Focus on the top 5 dates with the highest number of missing records
2. **Sequential Processing**: Process one date at a time to avoid connection issues
3. **Batch Size Control**: Use very small batch sizes (as low as 1) for problematic dates
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Track progress daily with analyze_reconciliation.sh

## Challenges and Solutions

### Connection Timeouts
- **Challenge**: Database connection timeouts during batch processing
- **Solution**: One-by-one record processing with minimal_reconciliation.ts and adequate pauses

### Resource Constraints
- **Challenge**: Limited database resources causing query timeouts
- **Solution**: Process during off-peak hours and use minimal connections

### Large Data Volume
- **Challenge**: Over 1 million missing records to process
- **Solution**: Prioritize critical dates and implement checkpointing for resumable processing

## Next Steps

1. Complete reconciliation of 2022-10-06 (currently in progress)
2. Move to 2022-06-11 using process_critical_date.sh
3. Process remaining top 5 critical dates using process_critical_batch.sh
4. Re-evaluate strategy for remaining missing records
5. Implement automated daily reconciliation checks

## Continuous Monitoring

We have implemented several monitoring tools:
- Daily reconciliation status checks with analyze_reconciliation.sh
- Database connection monitoring with connection_timeout_analyzer.ts
- Progress visualization with reconciliation_visualization.ts

These tools help us track progress and identify potential issues before they become critical.
