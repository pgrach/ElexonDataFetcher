# Reconciliation Progress Report

## Current Status (As of February 28, 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Expected Calculations | 2,102,568 |
| Actual Calculations | 1,070,394 |
| **Completion Percentage** | **50.91%** |
| Target Percentage | 75% |

## Critical Dates Requiring Attention

The following dates have the most missing calculations and should be prioritized:

1. 2022-10-06 (17,687 missing calculations)
2. 2022-06-11 (16,979 missing calculations)
3. 2022-11-10 (15,486 missing calculations)
4. 2022-06-12 (13,503 missing calculations)
5. 2022-10-09 (11,715 missing calculations)

## Recent Progress

- **February 28, 2025**:
  - Fixed type errors in `connection_timeout_analyzer.ts` and `minimal_reconciliation.ts`
  - Created automated reconciliation script (`auto_reconcile.sh`) with timeout handling
  - Added comprehensive documentation for reconciliation process
  - Current completion: 50.91%

- **February 27, 2025**:
  - Implemented `efficient_reconciliation.ts` with batch processing and checkpointing
  - Created `minimal_reconciliation.ts` for handling problematic dates
  - Addressed timeout issues in database connections
  - Current completion: 48.53%

- **February 26, 2025**:
  - Analyzed database connection issues and implemented diagnostics
  - Added progress reporting tools
  - Began processing 2022 data
  - Current completion: 43.12%

## Reconciliation Priority Plan

1. **High Priority (March 1-5)**:
   - Process top 5 missing dates using minimal reconciliation tool
   - Complete October 2022 reconciliation
   - Develop daily automated checks

2. **Medium Priority (March 6-15)**:
   - Process June 2022 data
   - Ensure current month (February 2025) is fully reconciled
   - Implement monitoring alerts for reconciliation status

3. **Low Priority (March 16-31)**:
   - Backfill remaining historical data
   - Optimize reconciliation algorithms for better performance
   - Document lessons learned and best practices

## Performance Observations

- Dates in 2022 have significantly more missing calculations than recent dates
- Database connection timeouts are more common when processing dates with high curtailment volume
- Processing in batches of 5-10 records works best for older data
- Processing in batches of 50 works well for recent data

## Known Issues

1. **Connection Timeouts**:
   - Occurs primarily when processing October 2022 data
   - Workaround: Use `minimal_reconciliation.ts` with batch size of 1-2

2. **Large Data Volumes**:
   - Some specific dates (2022-10-06, 2022-06-11) have unusually high curtailment records
   - Workaround: Process these dates individually with specialized tools

3. **Concurrent Processing Limitations**:
   - Processing multiple dates concurrently can lead to connection pool exhaustion
   - Workaround: Process dates sequentially rather than in parallel

## Next Steps

1. Execute the automated reconciliation script to begin processing the top missing dates
2. Implement daily reconciliation checks to catch new discrepancies early
3. Monitor progress and adjust the strategy based on results
