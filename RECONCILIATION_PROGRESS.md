# Reconciliation Progress Report

## Current Status
- **Overall Reconciliation**: 69.05% (1,043,955 out of 1,511,961 expected calculations)
- **Missing Calculations**: 468,006
- **Bitcoin Calculations by Model**:
  - S19J_PRO: 347,991
  - S9: 347,983
  - M20S: 347,981

## Recent Progress
- Created comprehensive reconciliation toolkit
- Implemented batch processing with checkpoint functionality
- Added detailed monitoring and reporting capabilities
- Successfully processed several problematic dates
- Fixed LSP errors in key components

## Problem Areas
The following date ranges contain the majority of missing calculations:
- **2023-09**: 16 dates with missing calculations
- **2023-10**: 28 dates with missing calculations
- **2023-11**: 6 dates with missing calculations

Most critical dates (by missing calculations count):
1. 2022-10-06: 17,691 missing
2. 2022-06-11: 16,979 missing
3. 2022-11-10: 15,486 missing
4. 2022-06-12: 13,503 missing
5. 2022-10-09: 11,715 missing

## Work in Progress
- Processing 2023-10-29 with minimal reconciliation (4,203 calculations)
- Processing 2022-10-06 with minimal reconciliation (17,691 calculations)
- Testing daily reconciliation automation script

## Action Plan
1. **Short-term:**
   - Complete processing of most critical dates using minimal_reconciliation.ts
   - Fix LSP errors in reconciliation tools
   - Test and optimize auto_reconcile.sh script

2. **Mid-term:**
   - Process all missing dates from 2023-09 to 2023-11
   - Improve batch processing to handle larger datasets
   - Implement monitoring dashboard for reconciliation progress

3. **Long-term:**
   - Achieve and maintain 100% reconciliation
   - Setup daily automated checks to catch new issues
   - Optimize system for handling large data volumes

## Performance Metrics
- **Average Processing Time**: 2.0 seconds per calculation
- **Timeout Frequency**: Approximately every 150-200 calculations in batch mode
- **Success Rate**: 100% for minimal reconciliation tool, 95% for efficient reconciliation

## Next Steps
1. Continue processing 2022-10-06 and 2023-10-29 with minimal reconciliation
2. Fix LSP errors in connection_timeout_analyzer.ts and minimal_reconciliation.ts
3. Setup daily reconciliation check using auto_reconcile.sh
4. Process remaining October 2023 dates using minimal reconciliation

## Notes
- The minimal_reconciliation.ts tool successfully processes problematic dates but is slow due to conservative processing approach
- Connection timeouts remain a challenge for larger batch sizes
- Consider optimizing database connection pool settings for better performance
- Progress checkpoint files sometimes become corrupted due to timeouts
