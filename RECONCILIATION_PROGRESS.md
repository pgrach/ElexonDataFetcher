# Reconciliation System Progress Report

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of our unified reconciliation system implementation for ensuring data consistency between `curtailment_records` and `historical_bitcoin_calculations` tables.

## Current Status

- ✅ **Unified Reconciliation Core**: Implemented and verified core functionality
- ✅ **Enhanced Daily Checks**: Updated daily checks to use the unified system
- ✅ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive reconciliation guide
- ✅ **Verification Script**: Implemented simple verification script 
- ✅ **Shell Wrapper**: Created shell script wrapper for easier command execution
- ✅ **Exception Handling**: Added robust error handling and retry logic
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces and type checks

## Recent Changes (Feb 28, 2025)

1. **Enhanced Exception Handling**
   - Added exponential backoff strategy for critical operations
   - Implemented cleanup routines for failed connections

2. **Verification System**
   - Created `check_unified_reconciliation.ts` for simple system verification
   - Added module loading tests to catch import issues

3. **Daily Reconciliation Integration**
   - Updated `daily_reconciliation_check.ts` to use unified system
   - Added graceful fallback to legacy reconciliation methods
   - Improved type safety for function calls

4. **Documentation**
