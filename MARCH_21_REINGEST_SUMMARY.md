# March 21, 2025 Data Reingestion Summary

## Background

On March 21, 2025, the curtailment data ingested from the Elexon API was incomplete and contained discrepancies. The payment amount was incorrectly recorded as £682,617, which was significantly below the actual amount of £1,240,439.58 based on the Elexon API data. The energy curtailment value was also incorrect, showing 49,604.12 MWh instead of the correct 50,518.72 MWh.

## Problem Details

1. **Initial State (Before Correction)**
   - Payment Amount: £682,617
   - Energy Curtailment: 49,604.12 MWh

2. **Intermediate Correction Attempt**
   - Payment Amount: £1,171,353.13 (still incorrect)
   - Energy Curtailment: 52,890.45 MWh (overestimated)

3. **Correct Values (From Elexon API)**
   - Payment Amount: £1,240,439.58
   - Energy Curtailment: 50,518.72 MWh

## Solution Approach

We implemented a complete data reingestion process for March 21, 2025, which included:

1. **Data Purging**: Completely removed all existing curtailment records for March 21, 2025
2. **Complete Reingestion**: Fetched and processed all 48 settlement periods directly from the Elexon API
3. **Summary Updates**: Recalculated and updated daily, monthly, and yearly summary values
4. **Bitcoin Calculations**: Updated Bitcoin mining potential calculations based on the corrected data

## Scripts Used

1. `fixed_reingest_march_21.ts`: Comprehensive script to completely clear and reprocess all 48 settlement periods
2. `test_reingest_march_21.ts`: Test script to verify the reingestion process works correctly with a small batch of periods

## Results

After the data reingestion, the system now shows the correct values:

- Total Settlement Periods: 48 (complete for the day)
- Total Records Processed: 1,945
- Total Energy Curtailment: 50,518.72 MWh
- Total Payment: £1,240,439.58

## Impact on Summary Tables

The correction has also updated the following summary tables:

1. **Daily Summary for March 21, 2025**
   - Corrected Energy: 50,518.72 MWh
   - Corrected Payment: £1,240,439.58

2. **Monthly Summary for March 2025**
   - Updated Total Energy: 941,012.27 MWh
   - Updated Total Payment: £15,689,245.75

3. **Yearly Summary for 2025**
   - Updated Total Energy: 2,655,670.61 MWh
   - Updated Total Payment: £37,251,894.63

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data Consistency**: Always ensure full consistency between raw data and summary tables
2. **Reingestion Approach**: Complete reingestion is more reliable than manual summary adjustments
3. **Verification Process**: Always verify totals match expected values from the Elexon API
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of correction processes for future reference

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement automated daily reconciliation checks to compare API data with stored data
2. Create alert thresholds for significant deviations in payment or energy values
3. Maintain a standardized reingestion procedure for addressing data discrepancies
4. Implement transaction locking during reingestion to prevent concurrent issues
