# March 21, 2025 Data Reingestion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process and results of reingesting all settlement period data for March 21, 2025 to correct a payment discrepancy. The original payment amount was £682,617, which was significantly below the expected payment of £1,240,439.58.

## Reingestion Process

### Steps Taken
1. Cleared all existing data for March 21, 2025 using `clear_march_21_data.ts`
2. Created `staged_reingest_march_21.ts` to use the batch processing approach from the March 28 reingestion process
3. Processed all 48 settlement periods in smaller batches of 4-6 periods each to prevent API timeouts:
   - Batch 1: Periods 1-6
   - Batch 2: Periods 7-12
   - Batch 3: Periods 13-18
   - Batch 4: Periods 19-24
   - Batch 5: Periods 25-30
   - Batch 6: Periods 31-36
   - Batch 7: Periods 37-42
   - Batch 8: Periods 43-48
4. Updated summary tables for daily, monthly, and yearly totals using `update_march_21_summaries.ts`
5. Recalculated Bitcoin mining potential for all miner models

### Results
- **All 48 settlement periods** were successfully processed
- **2,015 curtailment records** were ingested
- **Total volume**: 50,518.72 MWh
- **Total payment**: £1,240,439.58

## Payment Verification

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Expected payment | £1,240,439.58 |
| Actual payment | £1,240,439.58 |
| Difference | £0.00 |
| Percentage difference | 0.00% |

The final payment total exactly matches the expected amount of £1,240,439.58, confirming the successful reingestion of data. The staged reingestion approach using smaller batch sizes proved effective in handling all settlement periods without timeouts.

## Bitcoin Calculations
Bitcoin mining potential calculations were successfully updated for all miner models with a total of 74.60 BTC mined across all models.

## Settlement Period Analysis
The data shows significant variation in curtailment volume and payment across different settlement periods:
- Highest payment periods: 27-32 (approximately £90,000-£94,000 per period)
- Highest volume periods: 31-32 (approximately 1,900 MWh per period)
- Highest record count periods: 34 (103 records)

## Conclusion
The March 21, 2025 data reingestion was successfully completed, achieving the exact target payment amount of £1,240,439.58. All 48 settlement periods have been fully processed with comprehensive records in the database.

The reingestion process demonstrated the effectiveness of our staged batch processing approach, which will be documented as a standard procedure for handling data corrections in the future.
