# Reconciliation System Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the Bitcoin mining reconciliation system to address connection stability issues, improve error handling, and enhance the overall reliability of the reconciliation process.

## Key Issues Addressed

- **EPIPE errors**: Fixed connection handling in `minimal_reconciliation.ts` to properly handle broken pipe errors
- **Database connection timeouts**: Enhanced connection pool configuration and implemented proper connection cleanup
- **Process resilience**: Added checkpoint-based processing to allow resuming interrupted reconciliation
- **Error handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with retries and exponential backoff
- **Logging**: Improved logging to provide better visibility into the reconciliation process

## Enhanced Components

### 1. Minimal Reconciliation Tool (`minimal_reconciliation.ts`)

The lightweight reconciliation tool has been enhanced with:

- Robust error handling for EPIPE and connection errors
- Better logging with error handling for stdout/stderr issues
- Improved database connection pool management with auto-refresh
- Global error handlers for uncaught exceptions
- Safe process exit handling to ensure proper cleanup
- Checkpointing for resilient processing

### 2. Critical Date Processing (`process_critical_date.sh`)

The script for processing problematic dates now includes:

- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper error handling for all operations
- Direct database status checking as a fallback
- Connection cleanup to prevent lingering connections
- Log file management with automatic backup
- Improved process monitoring and reporting

### 3. Auto Reconciliation (`auto_reconcile.sh`)

The automated reconciliation tool now features:

- Adaptive batch size based on connection performance
- Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- Checkpoint-based processing for resumability
- Connection monitoring and cleanup
- Detailed progress reporting and status checks
- Prioritized processing of critical dates

### 4. Daily Reconciliation Check (`daily_reconciliation_check.ts`)

The daily monitoring script has been enhanced with:

- TypeScript-based retry and error handling
- Checkpoint-based processing
- Integration with both standard and targeted reconciliation methods
- Detailed status reporting and verification
- Configurable date range and processing options

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Handling Improvements

```typescript
// Enhanced database pool configuration
const pool = new pg.Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 2,                     // Limited number of connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 10000,   // Close idle connections after 10 seconds
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000, // Longer timeout for connections
  query_timeout: 15000,       // Increased query timeout
  allowExitOnIdle: true       // Allow connections to close when idle
});

// Add error handler to pool
pool.on('error', (err) => {
  // Error handling code
});
```

### Error Handling for EPIPE Errors

```typescript
// EPIPE error handler
process.stdout.on('error', (err) => {
  if (err && (err as any).code === 'EPIPE') {
    // Silently handle broken pipe - this is expected in some cases
    process.exit(0);
  }
});

// Robust logging function
function log(message: string, type: 'info' | 'error' | 'success' | 'warning' = 'info'): void {
  try {
    console.log(formatted);
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle stdout pipe errors silently
    if (err && (err as any).code !== 'EPIPE') {
      process.stderr.write(`Error writing to console: ${err}\n`);
    }
  }
  
  try {
    fs.appendFileSync(LOG_FILE, formatted + '\n');
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle file write errors
  }
}
```

### Connection Pool Refresh Strategy

```typescript
// Refresh database connection pool periodically
if (i > 0 && i % (batchSize * 5) === 0) {
  try {
    // Gracefully close the pool
    await pool.end();
  } catch (err) {
    // Continue anyway
  }
  
  await sleep(3000); // Longer pause to ensure connections are closed
  
  try {
    // Recreate pool with improved settings
    Object.assign(pool, new pg.Pool({
      // Pool configuration
    }));
  } catch (err) {
    // Create a fallback pool with minimal settings
  }
}
```

### Checkpoint-Based Processing

```typescript
// Save checkpoint
const checkpoint = {
  date,
  totalTasks: tasks.length,
  processed: 0,
  success: 0,
  failed: 0,
  startTime: Date.now()
};

fs.writeFileSync(CHECKPOINT_FILE, JSON.stringify(checkpoint, null, 2));

// Update checkpoint during processing
checkpoint.processed = processed;
checkpoint.success = success;
checkpoint.failed = failed;
fs.writeFileSync(CHECKPOINT_FILE, JSON.stringify(checkpoint, null, 2));
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Critical Dates

When processing dates with many missing calculations (like 2022-10-06), use:

```bash
./process_critical_date.sh 2022-10-06
```

This will:
1. Perform a status check to understand the reconciliation gap
2. Use a sequence of minimal database operations with strict error handling
3. Process records in small batches with pauses to prevent timeouts
4. Verify the reconciliation status after processing

### For Bulk Reconciliation

For regular bulk reconciliation with adaptive batch sizing:

```bash
./auto_reconcile.sh 5
```

This will:
1. Analyze the reconciliation status across all dates
2. Identify and prioritize critical dates with many missing calculations
3. Adjust batch size dynamically based on database performance
4. Process dates in order of criticality
5. Provide detailed reporting on the reconciliation progress

### For Daily Verification

To verify and fix recent data:

```bash
npx tsx daily_reconciliation_check.ts 2 false
```

Parameters:
- First parameter: Number of days to check (default: 2)
- Second parameter: Force processing even if fully reconciled (default: false)

## Monitoring and Reporting

The system now provides enhanced monitoring and reporting capabilities:

- Detailed logs in the `logs/` directory
- Checkpoint files to track progress
- Status reporting in console output
- Error diagnostics and tracing

## Conclusion

These enhancements have significantly improved the reliability and resilience of the reconciliation process. The system can now handle large volumes of data, recover from failures, and provide clear visibility into the reconciliation status.
