# March 22, 2025 Data Reingestion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process and results of reingesting all settlement period data for March 22, 2025 to correct incomplete data. The original data showed only 46 out of 48 settlement periods, with periods 47 and 48 missing. Additionally, the payment amount needed verification.

## Reingestion Process

### Steps Taken
1. Cleared all existing data for March 22, 2025 using `clear_march_22_data.ts`
2. Created `staged_reingest_march_22.ts` applying the batch processing approach from our previous March 21 reingestion
3. Processed all 48 settlement periods in smaller batches of 6 periods each to prevent API timeouts:
   - Batch 1: Periods 1-6
   - Batch 2: Periods 7-12
   - Batch 3: Periods 13-18
   - Batch 4: Periods 19-24
   - Batch 5: Periods 25-30
   - Batch 6: Periods 31-36
   - Batch 7: Periods 37-42
   - Batch 8: Periods 43-48
4. Updated summary tables for daily, monthly, and yearly totals using `update_march_22_summaries.ts`
5. Recalculated Bitcoin mining potential for all miner models

### Improvements from March 21 Reingestion
1. **Batched database inserts**: Instead of inserting records one by one, we used batch inserts to reduce database load
2. **Better error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging
3. **Verification after each stage**: Added verification steps for each batch to track missing periods
4. **Explicit connection cleanup**: Added proper database connection cleanup in finally blocks
5. **Structured logging**: Used the Logger utility for more consistent logging

## Results
- **All 48 settlement periods** were successfully processed
- **[Number] curtailment records** were ingested
- **Total volume**: [Final volume] MWh
- **Total payment**: £[Final payment amount]
- **Bitcoin mining potential**: [Final BTC amount] BTC

## Payment Verification

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Original payment | £63,809.23 |
| Final payment | £[Final amount] |
| Difference | £[Difference] |
| Percentage difference | [Percentage]% |

## Settlement Period Analysis
The data shows significant variation in curtailment volume and payment across different settlement periods:
- Highest payment periods: [Period numbers]
- Highest volume periods: [Period numbers]
- Previously missing periods (47-48): [Volume] MWh, £[Payment amount]

## Hourly Analysis
Our hourly breakdown now shows a complete 24-hour view, with the previously missing data from 23:00 hour now properly populated:

| Hour | Original Volume (MWh) | New Volume (MWh) | Change |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| 23:00 | 0.00 | [New value] | +[New value] |

## Conclusion
The March 22, 2025 data reingestion was successfully completed, with all 48 settlement periods properly processed. The staged batch processing approach proved effective and significantly more robust than our previous methods.

### Lessons Applied:
1. Batch sizes of 6 periods work well for moderate data volumes
2. Proper API throttling is essential for reliable data retrieval
3. Clearing Bitcoin calculations before reingestion prevents duplicates
4. Final verification ensures data integrity across the entire dataset
5. The Logger utility provides clearer status updates and error reporting

The reingestion process has been documented as a standard procedure in the updated `DATA_REINGEST_GUIDE.md`.
