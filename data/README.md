# Bitcoin Mining Analytics Platform - Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the Bitcoin Mining Analytics platform.

## Directory Structure

- `checkpoints/` - Checkpoint files for long-running processes

## Checkpoint Files

The `checkpoints/` directory contains JSON files that store the state of long-running processes, allowing them to be resumed if interrupted:

- `reconciliation_checkpoint.json` - Used by the unified reconciliation system
- `daily_reconciliation_checkpoint.json` - Used by the daily reconciliation check

Example checkpoint file structure:
```json
{
  "lastProcessedDate": "2025-03-05",
  "pendingDates": ["2025-03-06", "2025-03-07"],
  "completedDates": ["2025-03-01", "2025-03-02", "2025-03-03", "2025-03-04"],
  "startTime": 1709742856123,
  "lastUpdateTime": 1709743156789,
  "stats": {
    "totalRecords": 8564,
    "processedRecords": 7231,
    "successfulRecords": 7189,
    "failedRecords": 42,
    "timeouts": 3
  }
}
```

## Usage

Checkpoint files are used automatically by the reconciliation scripts. You should not need to edit these files manually. If a process was interrupted and you want to restart from scratch, you can delete the checkpoint file, and the process will start from the beginning.

## Maintenance

Checkpoint files are typically small and do not require regular cleanup. However, it's good practice to:

1. Verify that checkpoint files are valid JSON before attempting to resume a process
2. Remove checkpoint files if you want to force a complete restart of a process
3. Back up checkpoint files before critical operations

## Data Integrity

The checkpoint system ensures that:

1. Long-running processes can be safely interrupted and resumed
2. Progress is tracked at a granular level to minimize duplicate work
3. Statistics are maintained for monitoring and reporting

## Other Data Files

While the main data is stored in the PostgreSQL database, the `data/` directory may also contain:

- Temporary export files
- Configuration backups
- Sample data for testing
- Cached API responses

These files may be generated by scripts or manually created for specific purposes.
