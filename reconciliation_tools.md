# Reconciliation Tools Organization

After reviewing our codebase, we've identified significant duplication and overlap in our reconciliation scripts. 
Here's a plan to consolidate these tools into a cleaner, more maintainable structure:

## Files to Keep

1. `reconciliation.ts` - Primary consolidated reconciliation tool
2. `daily_reconciliation_check.ts` - Automated daily verification
3. `optimized_reconcile.ts` - For large-scale batched processing
4. `RECONCILIATION_PROGRESS.md` - Documentation of current status
5. `reconciliation_progress_check.ts` - Status reporting tool

## Files to Remove (Functionality Merged)

1. `accelerated_reconcile.ts` (merged into optimized_reconcile.ts)
2. `check_reconciliation_status.ts` (merged into reconciliation_progress_check.ts)
3. `comprehensive_reconcile_runner.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
4. `comprehensive_reconcile.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
5. `fix_december_2023.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
6. `reconcile_batch.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
7. `reconcile_batch_limit.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
8. `reconcile_date_period_combination.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
9. `reconcile_december.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
10. `reconcile_december_optimized.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
11. `reconcile_periods.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
12. `reconcile_single_date.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
13. `reconcile_single_period.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
14. `reconcile_specific_combo.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
15. `reconcile_top_missing.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
16. `reconciliation_progress_report.ts` (merged into reconciliation_progress_check.ts)
17. `reconciliation_visualization.ts` (optional, can keep if visualization is needed)
18. `run_reconciliation.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)
19. `test_reconcile_date.ts` (merged into reconciliation.ts)

## Consolidated File Structure

```
reconciliation/
├── reconciliation.ts             # Main reconciliation tool with CLI interface
├── optimized_reconcile.ts        # Performance-optimized version for large batches
├── daily_reconciliation_check.ts # Automated daily verification
├── reconciliation_progress_check.ts # Status reporting tool
└── docs/
    ├── RECONCILIATION_PROGRESS.md # Current status documentation
    └── reconciliation_plan.md     # Reconciliation strategy
```

This consolidation will make the codebase more maintainable while preserving all the key functionality we've developed.
