# Bitcoin Calculation Reconciliation Action Plan

## Current Status
- Overall reconciliation: 66.27% (1,001,851 out of 1,511,868 calculations)
- Fully reconciled dates: 2023-12-16, 2023-12-22, 2025-02-28 (current date)
- Partially reconciled: 2023-12-21 (33.33% complete - 1,443/4,329 calculations)
- Main bottleneck: December 2023 data

## Priority Actions

### Phase 1: Complete December 2023 Reconciliation
1. **Finish 2023-12-21 Processing**
   - Current status: 33.33% complete (1,443/4,329 calculations)
   - Action: Resume batch processing using `reconcile_batch.ts`
   - Expected completion: 2-3 batch runs

2. **Process Remaining High-Priority December Dates**
   - Order of processing:
     1. 2023-12-24 (4,659 missing calculations)
     2. 2023-12-23 (3,258 missing calculations) 
     3. 2023-12-17 (3,258 missing calculations)
     4. 2023-12-20 (2,562 missing calculations)
     5. 2023-12-19 (1,953 missing calculations)
     6. 2023-12-18 (453 missing calculations)
   - Tool: Use `reconcile_batch.ts` with batches of 2-3 dates per run
   - Verification: Check status after each batch using SQL queries

### Phase 2: Expand to Other Months
1. **Identify Next Priority Month**
   - Action: Run database query to find months with highest missing calculations
   - Tool: Create SQL query to identify missing calculations by month

2. **Establish Month-by-Month Schedule**
   - Create monthly reconciliation batches
   - Process systematically using `comprehensive_reconcile_runner.ts`
   - Verify each month before proceeding to next

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Daily Verification**
   - Use updated `daily_reconciliation_check.ts` for automated checks
   - Confirm new data is being reconciled properly

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Schedule weekly comprehensive reconciliation checks
   - Implement monitoring for any new reconciliation gaps

## Technical Enhancements
1. **Optimize Batch Processing**
   - Increase concurrency for faster processing
   - Implement memory management to prevent timeouts

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Enhanced logging for failed reconciliations
   - Automatic retry mechanism for transient failures

3. **Reporting Dashboard**
   - Create reconciliation progress dashboard
   - Generate weekly reconciliation reports

## Expected Timeline
- Phase 1 (December 2023): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Other Months): 5-7 days
- Phase 3 (Ongoing Monitoring): Continuous

## Success Criteria
- 100% reconciliation between curtailment_records and historical_bitcoin_calculations
- Automated daily verification confirming ongoing reconciliation
- Documented process for handling any future reconciliation gaps
