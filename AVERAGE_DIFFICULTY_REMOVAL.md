# Average Difficulty Column Removal

## Overview

As part of ongoing database optimization efforts, we have removed the `average_difficulty` column from the `bitcoin_daily_summaries` table. This change follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle as this data is already available in the `historical_bitcoin_calculations` table.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `average_difficulty` column from the `bitcoin_daily_summaries` table in the database
2. Updated the Drizzle schema definition in `db/schema.ts` to reflect this change
3. Modified all scripts that interact with the table to no longer reference this column:
   - `server/scripts/rebuild_bitcoin_summaries.ts`
   - `server/scripts/update_bitcoin_daily_summaries.ts`

## Reasoning

- **Redundancy Elimination**: The `average_difficulty` was redundant since this data is already stored in `historical_bitcoin_calculations` and can be calculated on demand if needed
- **Consistency**: This change brings the system in line with our practice of not duplicating data across tables
- **Performance**: Reducing redundant data fields can improve database performance and reduce storage requirements

## Migration

A migration script (`server/scripts/remove_average_difficulty_column.ts`) was created to safely remove this column from the database. The script handles checking if the column exists before attempting to remove it, ensuring idempotent execution.

To run this migration:

```bash
./remove_average_difficulty_column.sh
```

## Affected Components

This change doesn't affect any API endpoints as none of them were directly exposing this field to clients. All data presentation continues to function normally after this change.

## Verification

The removal has been tested with:

1. Successfully running the migration script
2. Running data update scripts for specific dates
3. Verifying API endpoints still function correctly
4. Verifying that the web application displays all data properly

## Related Changes

This change follows a similar pattern to the removal of the `value_at_mining` column documented in `VALUE_AT_MINING_REMOVAL.md`.
