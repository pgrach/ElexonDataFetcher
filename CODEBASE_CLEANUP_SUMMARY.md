# Codebase Cleanup and Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization efforts performed on the codebase to improve maintainability, reduce cognitive load, and establish a clearer separation between active core functionality and one-time utility scripts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Script Categorization

Scripts have been categorized based on their purpose and usage frequency:

- **Active Core Scripts**: Essential scripts that are part of the core functionality
- **Maintenance Scripts**: Scripts that need to be run periodically but not as part of daily operations
- **Data Processing Scripts**: Scripts for data ingestion, processing, and validation
- **One-time Utility Scripts**: Scripts created for specific one-time operations

### 2. Directory Reorganization

The following directory structure has been implemented:

```
server/
  ├── scripts/                 # Active scripts
  │   ├── data/                # Data processing scripts
  │   │   ├── ingestMonthlyData.ts
  │   │   ├── processDifficultyMismatch.ts
  │   │   ├── updateHistoricalCalculations.ts
  │   │   └── README.md
  │   ├── maintenance/         # Maintenance scripts
  │   │   ├── updateBmuMapping.ts
  │   │   └── README.md
  │   └── README.md            # General scripts documentation
  └── ...

backup/                        # Archived scripts
  ├── server_scripts/          # Deprecated server scripts
  │   ├── auditCurtailmentData.ts
  │   ├── auditDecember2022.ts
  │   ├── ...
  │   ├── updateDifficulty.ts
  │   └── updateLeadPartyNames.ts
  └── ...
```

### 3. Scripts Moved to Backup

The following scripts have been identified as one-time utilities or deprecated functionality and moved to the backup directory:

- **updateLeadPartyNames.ts**: Broken script with missing dependency
- **updateDifficulty.ts**: One-time script for a specific date (2025-02-10)
- **reprocessMonthlySummaries.ts**: One-time utility for bulk recalculation

### 4. Documentation Updates

Documentation has been enhanced across the project:

- **New README Files**: Added detailed README files to each scripts directory
- **RECONCILIATION.md Update**: Updated reconciliation documentation to reflect the new organization
- **Backup Documentation**: Enhanced the backup/README.md with details about moved scripts

### 5. Process Improvements

The reorganization improves the development workflow by:

- Clearly separating one-time utilities from regularly used scripts
- Providing detailed documentation for each script category
- Establishing a consistent directory structure for scripts based on purpose
- Standardizing the approach to script management

## Benefits

This reorganization delivers several benefits:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on active, relevant code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear organization makes the codebase easier to maintain
3. **Better Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the project structure
4. **Preserved History**: Moved scripts are preserved for reference while decluttering active codebase
5. **Enhanced Documentation**: Each script category now has detailed documentation
