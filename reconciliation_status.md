# Bitcoin Mining Data Reconciliation Project

## Project Summary
This project ensures 100% reconciliation between curtailment_records and historical_bitcoin_calculations tables, providing accurate mining potential calculations for all curtailment periods across all farm locations and miner models.

## Current Status
- **Overall Reconciliation**: 66.27% (1,001,851 out of 1,511,868 calculations)
- **Fully Reconciled Dates**: 2023-12-16, 2023-12-22, 2025-02-28 (current date)
- **Partially Reconciled Dates**: 2023-12-21 (33.33% complete - 1,443/4,329 calculations)
- **Priority Unprocessed Dates**: 2023-12-23, 2023-12-24, 2023-12-17, 2023-12-20, 2023-12-19, 2023-12-18

## Major Accomplishments
1. Created robust reconciliation framework with multiple specialized tools
2. Implemented daily reconciliation check for current date validation
3. Built comprehensive batch processing capabilities for efficient reconciliation
4. Developed progress tracking and reporting tools
5. Successfully reconciled several high-priority dates

## Technical Details
- Each date requires calculations for three miner models:
  - S19J_PRO (high efficiency)
  - S9 (standard)
  - M20S (medium efficiency)
- Reconciliation utilizes historical difficulty data from AWS DynamoDB
- Processing engine optimized for batched operations to improve efficiency
- Daily checks ensure no regression of current data

## Priority Improvements
1. **Focused December 2023 Processing**: December 2023 contains the highest number of missing calculations
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Daily reconciliation check now verifies recent data
3. **Enhanced Reporting**: Detailed status reports for tracking progress
4. **Optimized Database Queries**: Improved performance for large-scale reconciliation operations

## Upcoming Tasks
1. Complete processing of remaining December 2023 dates
2. Expand reconciliation to other months with missing data
3. Implement additional verification tests
4. Setup continuous monitoring to prevent future reconciliation gaps

## Performance Metrics
- **Processing Rate**: ~4,600 calculations per run
- **Reconciliation Increase**: +0.82% overall (+10,800 calculations)
- **Target Completion**: Full reconciliation expected through incremental batch processing
