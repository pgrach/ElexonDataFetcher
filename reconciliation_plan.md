# Bitcoin Calculation Reconciliation Plan

## Current Status Summary (Feb 28, 2025)

- **Total Reconciliation Progress: 43.24%** (902,455 of 2,087,079 required records)
- **Per-Year Completion Rates:**
  - 2022: 16.74% (103,387 of 617,649 required)
  - 2023: 0.05% (204 of 392,097 required) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
  - 2024: 81.28% (678,951 of 835,302 required)
  - 2025: 49.54% (119,913 of 242,031 required)

## Reconciliation Approach

We'll implement a systematic, focused approach to reconcile all missing Bitcoin calculations, prioritizing by year based on completion percentage.

### 1. Priority Order for Processing

1. **2023 (0.05% complete)** - Critical priority
2. **2022 (16.74% complete)** - High priority
3. **2025 (49.54% complete)** - Medium priority
4. **2024 (81.28% complete)** - Lower priority

### 2. Implementation Strategy

#### For Each Year:

1. Create dedicated reconciliation script
2. Process month by month in sequence
3. Implement recovery mechanisms to handle errors
4. Verify completion after each month
5. Generate comprehensive reports

### 3. Reconciliation Scripts

We'll create the following scripts:

- **reconcile_2023.sql** - For 2023 data (highest priority)
- **reconcile_2022.sql** - For 2022 data
- **reconcile_2025.sql** - For 2025 data
- **reconcile_2024.sql** - For 2024 data
- **complete_bitcoin_reconciliation.sql** - Master script to run all reconciliations

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Process data in smaller batch sizes to avoid memory issues
- Use optimized SQL queries with proper indexing
- Implement transaction blocks for data consistency
- Run during off-peak hours to minimize system impact

### 5. Verification and Validation

After each reconciliation batch:

- Verify correct counts for all miner models
- Compare against expected totals
- Generate logs with success/failure status
- Store progress metrics in separate tables

## Testing and Verification 

We have successfully tested our approach with:

1. **2023-01-15** - Added 180 calculation records (60 per miner model)
2. **2023-06-20** - Added 21 calculation records (7 per miner model)

These tests confirm that our reconciliation strategy works effectively.

## Expected Timeline

| Phase | Task | Estimated Completion | Records to Add |
|-------|------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Reconcile 2023 data | 3-4 days | ~392,000 |
| 2 | Reconcile 2022 data | 5-6 days | ~514,000 |
| 3 | Reconcile 2025 data | 2-3 days | ~122,000 |
| 4 | Reconcile 2024 data | 3-4 days | ~156,000 |
| 5 | Final verification | 1 day | - |

## Post-Reconciliation Steps

After achieving 100% reconciliation:

1. Implement preventive measures to avoid future discrepancies
2. Set up monitoring alerts for any new reconciliation issues
3. Document the process for future reference
4. Create automated scripts for ongoing reconciliation checks
