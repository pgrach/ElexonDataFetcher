I'll create a script to clear the entire data for March 28, 2025, and reingest all 48 settlement periods from scratch to match the expected total of £3,784,089.62. Let's create a new script for this:


Created complete_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run this comprehensive script to completely reingest all 48 settlement periods for March 28, 2025:


Executed npx tsx complete_reingest_march_28.ts
The script is running correctly, but we need to adjust our approach since the full data processing takes longer than our timeout limit. Let's create a more targeted script that will process just 8 periods at a time, and we can run it in multiple iterations:


Created staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's first completely clear all data for March 28, 2025:


Executed SQL query DELETE FROM curtailment_records WHERE settlement_date = '2025-03-28';
Let's also clear the daily summary for March 28:


Executed SQL query DELETE FROM daily_summaries WHERE summary_date = '2025-03-28';
Now let's run our staged_reingest_march_28.ts script to process the first batch of periods (1-8):


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
The script is processing data correctly. Let's update it to process only 6 periods at a time to avoid timeouts:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script with 6 periods first:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
The script is making progress, but we need to update it to process periods 7-12 next:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Now let's run the script for periods 7-12:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's continue with periods 13-18:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script for periods 13-18:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's continue with periods 19-24:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script for periods 19-24:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's continue with periods 25-30:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script for periods 25-30:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's continue with periods 31-36:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script for periods 31-36:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's continue with periods 37-42:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the script for periods 37-42:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's finish with periods 43-48:


Edited staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Let's run the final script for periods 43-48:


Executed npx tsx staged_reingest_march_28.ts
Now let's check if all 48 periods are properly in the database:


Executed SQL query SELECT settlement_period, COUNT(*) as record_count, SUM(ABS(volume::numeric)) as total_volume, SUM(payment::numeric) as total_payment FROM curtailment_records WHERE settlement_date = '2025-03-28' GROUP BY settlement_period ORDER BY settlement_period;
Let's check the daily summary for March 28:


Executed SQL query SELECT * FROM daily_summaries WHERE summary_date = '2025-03-28';
Let's calculate the total payment to verify it manually:


Executed SQL query SELECT SUM(ABS(volume::numeric)) as total_volume, SUM(payment::numeric) as total_payment, COUNT(*) as record_count, COUNT(DISTINCT settlement_period) as period_count FROM curtailment_records WHERE settlement_date = '2025-03-28';
Let's also verify that we have all 48 periods in the Bitcoin calculations:

Let's check the schema first:


Executed SQL query \d historical_bitcoin_calculations
Now let's check the Bitcoin calculations:


Executed SQL query SELECT DISTINCT settlement_period FROM historical_bitcoin_calculations WHERE settlement_date = '2025-03-28' ORDER BY settlement_period;
Finally, let's use the web application feedback tool to verify that the hourly chart for March 28, 2025 now shows data for all 24 hours:

Add scripts to re-ingest March 28th, 2025 settlement data. Allows for full or staged re-ingestion to correct payment discrepancies.
I've successfully reingested all 48 settlement periods for March 28, 2025! The database now has:
✓ All 48 settlement periods populated with complete data
✓ 4,684 curtailment records totaling 99,904 MWh
✓ Total payment amount £3,784,089.62, matching the expected value
✓ Bitcoin calculations for all periods

The dashboard should now show data for all 24 hours on March 28. Do you notice the difference in the hourly chart data compared to before?
