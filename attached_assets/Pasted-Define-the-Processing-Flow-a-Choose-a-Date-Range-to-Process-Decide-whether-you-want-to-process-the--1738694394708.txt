Define the Processing Flow
a. Choose a Date Range to Process
Decide whether you want to process the past year in one batch or in smaller, incremental batches (for example, daily or weekly).

b. For Each Date in the Range:

Fetch Curtailment Records:
Query your PostgreSQL curtailment_records table for that date.
You might group the records by settlement period and farm (if you want per-farm, per-period calculations) so that you sum up the curtailed energy (MWh) for each group.

Retrieve Historical Difficulty:
Query your historical difficulty from DynamoDB for the given date.
Since the difficulty is stored once per day, you can cache it locally within your batch run to avoid duplicate lookups.

(Optionally) Retrieve Historical Price Data:
If you also want the fiat value to reflect historical Bitcoin prices (instead of current price), fetch that value as well. Otherwise, you might keep using a constant or a separate conversion.

Run the Conversion Calculation:
For each settlement period (and each farm, if that matters), use your conversion logic. In your case, you can reuse (or slightly modify) your calculateBitcoinForBMU function to accept the aggregated curtailed energy (in MWh), the miner model, the retrieved historical difficulty, and the corresponding price.
The result should be the Bitcoin mined and its fiat value.

Upsert the Calculation Result:
Insert the computed result into the historical_bitcoin_calculations table. Use an upsert (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) strategy so that if the calculation for a given combination of settlement_date, settlement_period, farm_id, and miner_model already exists, it will be updated.

2. Implementation Considerations
Idempotency:
Design your job so that re-running it does not produce duplicate or inconsistent data. An upsert in PostgreSQL helps achieve this.

Batching:
If the data volume is large, process settlement periods or dates in batches to reduce memory overhead and avoid long-running transactions.

Error Handling:
Make sure to log errors and possibly mark dates that failed processing so that you can retry them later.

Performance:
Cache the historical difficulty (and historical price, if needed) per day during processing, so youâ€™re not making multiple calls to DynamoDB for the same date.
