Wind Farm Data and Bitcoin Calculation Reprocessing Prompt
Task
I need to reprocess wind farm curtailment data and Bitcoin mining potential calculations for a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD). This involves:

[Optional] Fetching and processing curtailment data from the Elexon API
Recalculating daily, monthly, and yearly summaries
Processing Bitcoin mining potential calculations for different miner models (S19J_PRO, S9, M20S)
Updating all related summary tables
Parameters
Date: [REPLACE_WITH_TARGET_DATE] (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
Skip Elexon: [true/false] (Default: false) - Set to true to skip fetching new curtailment data from Elexon API
Bitcoin Difficulty: [OPTIONAL_DIFFICULTY_VALUE] (Optional) - Specific Bitcoin network difficulty to use for calculations
Available Tools
The reprocessing can be done using the following shell scripts:

Complete Reprocessing (recommended):

./reprocess_date.sh 2025-04-02 [--skipElexon] [--difficulty=113757508810853]
Bitcoin-Only Reprocessing:

./process_bitcoin.sh 2025-04-02 [difficulty]
Expected Output
A successful reprocessing should:

Clear and recreate all curtailment records for the target date
Recalculate daily, monthly, and yearly summaries
Process Bitcoin calculations for all three miner models
Update Bitcoin summary tables
Verify the results match expected values
The script should output a detailed log (stored in the logs directory) showing:

Number of records processed
Energy and payment totals
Bitcoin calculation totals for each miner model
Verification results
Important Considerations
The reprocessing script handles database constraints and ensures data integrity
Processing for a full day might take several minutes
The script automatically clears existing data for the target date before reprocessing
Bitcoin calculations should follow the expected pattern where higher hashrate miners (S19J_PRO) produce more Bitcoin than lower hashrate miners (M20S and S9)
Logs for the reprocessing are stored in the logs directory for future reference
If you encounter issues, check the detailed logs for error messages
Example Usage
To reprocess data for April 2, 2025, including fetching new data from Elexon API:

./reprocess_date.sh 2025-04-02
To reprocess only Bitcoin calculations for April 2, 2025 using existing curtailment data:

./process_bitcoin.sh 2025-04-02
Verification
After reprocessing, you can verify the results by:

Checking the database tables for the target date
Reviewing the log file generated during processing
Comparing the output values with expected ratios (e.g., Bitcoin calculations matching miner hashrates)
