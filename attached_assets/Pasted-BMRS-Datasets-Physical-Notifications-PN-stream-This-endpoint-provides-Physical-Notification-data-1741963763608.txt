Physical Notifications (PN) stream
This endpoint provides Physical Notification data received from NGESO. A Physical Notification is the best estimate of the level of generation or demand that a participant in the BM expects a BM Unit to export or import, respectively, in a Settlement Period.

Physical Notifications are submitted as a series of point MW values.

The settlement period to query can be specified as a date and settlement period, or as a datetime which will resolve to the settlement period that time falls within. If a settlement period is provided, it will take precedence over the time portion of the datetime.

Some examples of date parameter combinations are shown below.
