1. Double-Counting or Duplicate Rows in Another Table/Environment
Check if you have re-ingested data multiple times.

Sometimes the same record can appear more than once in your curtailmentRecords table if the ingestion job was run repeatedly for the same date.
If you are running the query in one database (which shows single instances), but your code/aggregator is pointing to a different database (or schema) that includes duplicates, you’ll see different sums.
Are you summing the same row multiple times?

For example, if there is a JOIN somewhere else that multiplies the record count.
Or if each row has soFlag = true and cadlFlag = true, but the code is inadvertently adding the volume once for each flag (less likely with your CASE, but worth confirming).
Verify which environment your server is reading from.

Make sure the “dev” vs. “prod” (or local) database is the same one you’re querying manually.
2. “Hidden” Rows Not in Your CSV Listing
Even though the CSV you pasted shows ~40–50 rows for each period, double-check that:

You have not truncated the output (i.e. more rows exist).
Some rows might have negative or zero volumes that you did not list if you only included positive volumes. The aggregator might do a separate logic step (though normally that reduces totals, not increases them).
Some rows might come from other lead parties or appear with slightly different dates/times/time zones (e.g., 2024-01-24 00:00 UTC vs. 2024-01-24 local).
3. soFlag and cadlFlag Logic
Your code has:

sql
Copy
SUM(
  CASE 
    WHEN volume::numeric > 0
         AND (soFlag = true OR cadlFlag = true)
    THEN volume::numeric
    ELSE 0
  END
)
If you run a plain SELECT settlement_period, volume, lead_party_name without filtering on soFlag or cadlFlag, you will see rows that may not actually be counted in the aggregator.

Conversely, if your aggregator is capturing every row (maybe you changed the CASE logic?), it could include more than you expect.

Check a direct query to see only rows where (soFlag = TRUE OR cadlFlag = TRUE):

sql
Copy
SELECT settlement_period,
       volume,
       lead_party_name,
       soFlag,
       cadlFlag
  FROM curtailment_records
 WHERE settlement_date = '2024-01-24'
   AND settlement_period IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   AND volume > 0
   AND (soFlag = TRUE OR cadlFlag = TRUE)
 ORDER BY settlement_period, lead_party_name;
Then compare the sum of these volumes to the aggregator logs.

4. Potential Unit Conversions
Although your rows are in single/double digits, you mentioned the code logs “1585.18 MWh” for Period 1. One explanation is:

The aggregator might be multiplying the sum by some factor (e.g., 30 minutes → 0.5 hour → you’d normally multiply MW × 0.5 to get MWh, but maybe it’s reversed?).
Or you’re combining data for 24 hours in some way.
However, your raw data looks already to be in MWh scale (e.g., “29.325” for a half hour is a plausible MWh chunk). Usually, a mismatch goes in the other direction (kWh vs. MWh). But keep it on your debugging list in case there’s a half-hour => hour multiplier in the ingestion code.

5. Aggregator Summing Across Multiple Lead Parties Correctly?
Notice that for each settlement_period, you have many different lead_party_name entries: Moray Offshore Wind East, Seagreen Wind Energy, Corriegarth, etc. Summing them all up can push the number higher. A rough sum of all lines for Period 1 in your CSV is around ~900–1,000 total. That is still below 1,585.

If your aggregator logs ~1,585 for Period 1, it could be:

Summing the same data a second time from somewhere else (e.g., a second table or second run).
Possibly including rows from more periods than 1 (or from more dates) if the WHERE filter is off.
