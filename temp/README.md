# Bitcoin Mining Analytics Platform - Temporary Files

This directory contains temporary files and scripts used for development and debugging purposes.

## Files

- `process_date.ts` - Simple script to directly process a specific date using functions from services rather than the CLI tool

## Purpose

The temp directory serves as a staging area for:

1. Development scripts that are not part of the main application
2. Temporary files used during testing
3. Draft implementations before they are finalized
4. Debugging utilities

## Usage

Files in this directory are generally not meant for production use. They are intended for development and testing purposes only. Any critical functionality should be integrated into the main application structure.

## Important Notes

- Files in this directory may be deleted or modified at any time
- Do not rely on these files for critical operations
- Consider moving useful utilities to the appropriate scripts directory if they prove valuable
